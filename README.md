# Figma Chat Cursor

![Preview](https://github.com/Erik3010/figima-chat-cursor/blob/master/preview/preview.gif?raw=true)

## Description

A cursor-based chat application, similar to Figma, where users can communicate with each other using a chat box located directly below their cursor. This was build using React js and Node for the backend. I built to this to learn more about websockets and how to use them in a React application.

If you find any bugs, feels free to open an issue or pull request.
